My solutions to Code Wars Katas(Python)

The soltuions are written in Python 3.8(the website doesn't support 3.8 yet but the solutions works for 3.6 so I don't see a problem, yet) Noob programmer


!! NOTE !!
For all the solutions, the code returns print statements because I want to see what it returns. For submission, simply remove the print statements.
